# Notes App 📝

This is a simple text-based Notes App written in Java. It lets you add and view notes using the terminal.

I made this as part of my Java internship task at **Elevate Labs**.

## 💻 What It Can Do

- Add a new note (saved in `notes.txt`)
- View all saved notes
- Menu-based interface with options

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Java
- VS Code / Terminal
- FileWriter & BufferedReader

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Compile the Java file:

```bash
javac NotesApp.java
```

2. Run it:

```bash
java NotesApp
```

3. A file called `notes.txt` will be created in the same folder to store your notes.

## 📁 File Structure

- `NotesApp.java` → Main Java program
- `notes.txt` → All your saved notes will be stored here
- `README.md` → This file

## 🙌 Credits

Made by **Harithik Sharma** during my Java internship at **Elevate Labs**.

## ✅ Outcome

This project helped me understand how to use **FileReader** and **FileWriter** to save and read data from files.
